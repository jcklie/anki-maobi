*máobĭ* (毛笔) is an Anki add-on to create cards with writing quizzes for Hanzi (Chinese characters). Have a look:

Learning words consisting of more than one Hanzi also work (thanks to [arueckle](https://github.com/arueckle)):

## Motivation

Learning Chinese is difficult, remembering what you have learned even more so. I heavily rely on 
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to review my vocabulary. It has changed my study life and made it 
possible for me to remember all the words, characters, chengyu, sentences and pass my exams.

While Anki itself is good to remember the meaning of words and characters, I found it difficult to use 
for remembering writing Hanzi. There is the possiblity of using [AnkiDroid](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android) 
and the built-in whiteboard or defining a workflow as described in a [blog entry of EastAsiaStudent](https://eastasiastudent.net/study/skritter-functionality-for-free/). I tried it, but I did not like 
it too much.

A paid alternative that I used heavily in the past is [Skritter](https://skritter.com/). Right now, 
I really dislike the Version 2, their update policy and the bugs in the scheduling. It also is really 
unresponsive, making me wasting (lots of!) time by just waiting for the app. A contender of Skritter 
for mobile is [Inkstone](https://www.skishore.me/inkstone/), but I did not get warm with that either. 

Another aspect is that I personally do not like to use many different programs and tools to collect 
vocabulary. Therefore, I built *maobi* to remember writing Hanzi within *Anki*. Now, I have all my 
learning progress in one tool!

## Acknowledgement

I did not design the writing component, it comes from the awesome [Hanzi Writer](https://github.com/chanind/hanzi-writer) 
JavaScript library. Without it, this would not be possible. *maobi* merely bundles it with Anki. Please 
visit the *Hanzi Writer* website and look how nice it looks! 

The chinese character and stroke order data used by *Hanzi Writer* is derived from the 
[Make me a Hanzi](https://github.com/skishore/makemeahanzi). The data can be found in the 
[Hanzi Writer Data](https://github.com/chanind/hanzi-writer-data) repo.

## Quickstart

1. Install the addon via the code found on the [maobi Anki page](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/931477147).
2. Download and import the [example deck](https://github.com/Rentier/anki-maobi/blob/master/data/Maobi.apkg).
3. Restart Anki.
4. Open the deck and start writing!

## Configuration

In order to use *maobi* for your own deck, you need to follow these simple steps:

### Download the add-on from the Anki homepage

Use the code found on the [maobi Anki page](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/931477147).

### Have a deck which contains character notes

You need to create a note type which has a field that contains the character, e.g. `Hanzi`. The other 
fields are up to you. You can e.g. use the card types that come with the extremely useful 
[Chinese Support Redux add-on](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1128979221). 
When using this addon, you can optionally configure Maobi to display tone colors from the `Colors` field. 

Then, you need to create cards with this note type. I personally generated a deck with all important 
characters from [CC-CEDICT](https://cc-cedict.org/wiki/). After I imported it, I immediately suspended 
all cards. Whenever I want to learn a new character, I just search and then unsuspend it. This saves 
time from creating cards and looking up definitions.

### Insert place holder into a card template

In order to let *maobi* insert the quiz into a card, its template need to contain

    <div id="character-target-div"></div>

on the question side. In its position, the quiz will be inserted. 
In addition, an optional button may be inserted in the template to reveal the current character's strokes:

    <div id="reveal-character-btn" label="Reveal"></div>
    
Further, an optional button to restart the current quiz can be inserted. This will restart the quiz
of the current Hanzi if there are already completed strokes for this Hanzi, otherwise it will 
restart the quizzes of all Hanzi in the current card:

    <div id="restart-quiz-btn" label="Restart Quiz"></div>

You can add or overwrite the default style by using the `character-target-div` id, by adding e.g.

    #character-target-div > div { 
        background-color: magenta;
    }

to the CSS part in the card editor.

#### Example template

An example deck with example notes can be found in `data/Maobi.apkg` .

### Configure the decks and note types for which *maobi* is enabled

Before using *maobi*, it has to be specified for which decks and templates the add-on should be 
enabled. The field that contains the character to write also has to be given.

In order to tell *maobi* these values, you need to edit the add-on configuration. This can be done in the Card Layout view:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rentier/anki-maobi/master/img/config.png">
</p>

The configuration is done per deck and card template. The following paragraphs explains the values in detail.

<dl>
  <dt>Field</dt>
  <dd>The name of the field that should be used to quiz.</dd>
  
  <dt>Grid</dt>
  <dd>This specifies the type of grid background that will be used. Currently available are `None`, `Rice` or `Field`:
    <p align="center">
      <img src="img/grids.svg">
    </p> 
  </dd>  

  <dt>Size</dt>
  <dd>This specifies the size of the quiz box in px (default 200).</dd>
  
  <dt>Leniency</dt>
  <dd>This can be set to make stroke grading more or less lenient. The smaller this is, the more strictly the quiz is graded.</dd>

  <dt>Show hint after misses</dt>
  <dd>This specifies after how many wrong strokes a hint is displayed. 0 means never show hints (default 3).</dd>
  
</dl>

## Disclaimer

This add-on right now just contains a basic implementation. It is by no means feature complete or 
well-tested. If you have feature requests or encounter bugs, please open an issue in the 
[issue tracker](https://github.com/Rentier/anki-maobi/issues).

## Development

You can import this repository as a `poetry` package in the IDE of your choice. To test it with Anki,
I checkout this repository into my `git` folder, then symlink the `maobi` folder into `${AnkiData}\addons21`.

```
# Windows (as root)
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path C:\Users\klie\AppData\Roaming\Anki2\addons21\maobi -Target D:\git\anki-maobi\maobi\
```

### Releasing

1. Bump the version number in `maobi\__version__.py`
2. Run `scripts\package.py`
3. Upload to `https://ankiweb.net/shared/upload`

## FAQ

### Did you create the widget which asks me to write characters?

I did not design the writing component, it comes from the awesome [Hanzi Writer](https://github.com/chanind/hanzi-writer) 
JavaScript library. Without it, this would not be possible. *maobi* merely bundles it with Anki. Please 
visit the *Hanzi Writer* website and look how nice it looks!

### Can this be used on mobile?

Sadly, Anki desktop addons do not work on mobile. A workaround can be found [here](https://github.com/jcklie/anki-maobi/issues/20#issuecomment-578490050).
It uses the hand-written input of the mobile keyboard. An alternative to try is using [this](https://github.com/infinyte7/Anki-maobi) by [infinyte7](https://github.com/infinyte7).

### Does this run offline?

Yes, it does. *maobi* is bundled with the character data from the [Hanzi Writer Data](https://github.com/chanind/hanzi-writer-data)
 repo. The Javascript from [Hanzi Writer](https://github.com/chanind/hanzi-writer) is also shipped with this addon.

### Why is this add-on so large?

In order to generate the quizzes and display characters, stroke information is needed. Although the 
character data for one Hanzi is relatively small, it adds up when you support over 9000 characters. I 
already compressed the data to reduce the footprint.

### Using the mouse for writing is really uncomfy, is there a better way?

Yes. I personally use a Wacom graphics tablet, e.g. the [Wacom Intuos](https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/wacom-intuos).
